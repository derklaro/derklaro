### Hi there 👋

My name is Pasqual Koschmieder. I'm a computer science student from germany and a ☕ enthusiast.

✍️ Since August 2021 I am a software engineer at [EasyBill](https://easybill.de)

🌱 I'm currently mostly working on improving my PHP, Rust, Kotlin and Ruby Skills. My main programming language is Java.

🔭 In my freetime I work on projects like [aerogel](https://github.com/derklaro/aerogel) and [CloudNet](https://cloudnetservice.eu).

💬 Other than that I love to play video games, talk about science and politics, or vibin to chill music 😄
