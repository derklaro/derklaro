### Hi there 👋

My name is Pasqual Koschmieder. I'm a german student and a event technology lover. Most of my work is related to minecraft but i am involved in some other projects too.

✍️ I'm currently working on [ReformCloud](https://github.com/ReformCloud/reformcloud2), [CloudNet](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3), all projects of [PhantomPowered](https://github.com/PhantomPowered/), [HDSkins](https://github.com/HDSkins) and some other projects like my [dependency-to-file collection maven plugin](https://github.com/derklaro/dependency-list-maven-plugin).

🌱 I'm currently looking to improve my java and kotlin development skills.

💬 Outside of development and school stuff, I love to talk about history, technology, politics, technology and some other stuff.
